# print2pdf

This repository contains the source code to deploy a Microsoft Azure Function App with the purpose of converting a styled webpage into to an optimised PDF document.

The function application utilises Puppeteer to run a Chromium browser instance which has the in-built Print tool. Following the PDF creation, there is a layer of compression applied to ensure the produced PDFs are as web optimised as possible.Â
